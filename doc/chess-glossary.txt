A[edit]

absolute pin
    A pin against the king is called absolute since the pinned piece cannot
    legally move out of the line of attack (as moving it would expose the king
    to check).^[1] Cf. relative pin.
active
    Describes a piece that threatens a number of squares, or that has a number
    of squares available for its next move. It may also describe an aggressive
    style of play.^[2] Antonym: passive.
    [210px-Adjournment]
     
    Envelope used for the adjournment of a match game Efim Geller vs. Bent
    Larsen, Copenhagen 1966
adjournment
    Suspension of a chess game with the intention to finish it later. It was
    once very common in high-level competition, often occurring soon after the
    first time control, but the practice has been abandoned due to the advent
    of computer analysis.^[3] See also sealed move.
adjudication
    A way to decide the result of an unfinished game. A tournament director, or
    an impartial and strong player, will evaluate the final position and assign
    a win, draw, or loss assuming best play by both players.^[4]
adjust 
    See Touch-move rule. To adjust the position of a piece on its square
    without being required to move it. A player may only do this on their turn,
    and they must first say "I adjust", or the French equivalent J'adoube.^[5]
advanced pawn
    A pawn that is on the opponent's side of the board (the fifth rank or
    higher). An advanced pawn may be weak if it is overextended, lacking
    support and difficult to defend, or strong if it cramps the enemy by
    limiting mobility. An advanced passed pawn that threatens to promote can be
    especially strong.^[6]
advantage
    A better position with the chance of winning the game. Evaluation factors
    can include space, time, material, and threats.^[2]

    file.^[7]
    [242px-SCD_algebraic_notation]
    Algebraic notation
algebraic notation
    The standard way to record the moves of a chess game, using alphanumeric
    coordinates for the squares.^[8]
amateur
    Any player whose main occupation is not chess.^[9] The distinction between
    professional and amateur is not very important in chess as amateurs may win
    prizes, accept appearance fees, and earn any title, including World
    Champion.^[9]^[10] In the 19th century, "Amateur" was sometimes used in
    published game scores to conceal the name of the losing player in a Master
    vs. Amateur contest. It was thought to be impolite to use a player's name
    without permission, and the professional did not want to risk losing a
    customer.^[10] See also NN.
analysis
    The study of a game or a position, in order to evaluate the quality of the
    moves and various other aspects of the game or position. At the end of a
    game, the players will often do an analysis of the game. Cf. post-mortem.^
    [2]
annotation
    Written commentary on a game or a position using words, chess symbols or
    notation.^[2]
announced mate
    A practice, common in the 19th century, whereby a player would announce a
    sequence of moves, believed by him to constitute best play by both sides,
    that led to a forced checkmate for the announcing player in a specified
    number of moves (for example, "mate in five").^[11]
antipositional
    A move or a plan that is not in accordance with the principles of
    positional play.^[12] Antipositional is used to describe moves that are
    part of an incorrect plan rather than a mistake made when trying to follow
    a correct plan. Antipositional moves are often pawn moves; since pawns
    cannot move backwards to return to squares they have left, their advance
    can create irreparable weaknesses.^[13]
Anti-Sicilian
    An opening variation that White uses against the Sicilian Defense (1.e4 c5)
    other than the most common plan of 2.Nf3 followed by 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 (the
    Open Sicilian). Some Anti-Sicilians include the Alapin Variation (2.c3),
    Moscow Variation (2.Nf3 d6 3.Bb5+), Rossolimo Variation (2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5),
    Grand Prix Attack (2.Nc3 Nc6 3.f4 g6 4.Nf3 Bg7 and now 5.Bc4 or 5.Bb5),
    Closed Sicilian (2.Nc3 followed by g3 and Bg2), Smith–Morra Gambit (2.d4
    cxd4 3.c3), and Wing Gambit (2.b4).^[14]

Arabian mate
    A checkmate that occurs when the knight and rook trap the opposing king in
    a corner.^[15]
arbiter
    See International Arbiter.
Armageddon game
    A game that is guaranteed to produce a decisive result, because if there is
    a draw it is ruled a victory for Black. In compensation for this White is
    given more time on the clock. Often White is given six minutes, and Black
    five. This format is typically used in playoff tiebreakers when shorter
    blitz games have not resolved the tie.^[16]
artificial castling
    Refers to a maneuver of several separate moves by the king and by a rook
    where they end up as if they had castled. Also known as castling by hand.^
    [17]
attack
    An aggressive action on a part of the chessboard, or to threaten the
    capture of a piece or pawn.^[18] See also counterattack, discovered attack,
    double attack, mating attack, and minority attack. Antonym: defense.

    White wins with 1.Rd7+! The black king is attracted away from the defense
    of the black queen with a skewer.
attraction
    A type of decoy involving a sacrifice of a minor or major piece on a square
    next to the enemy king, forcing the king to abandon the defense of another
    square. For example (see diagram), the black queen has interposed to block
    a check from the white queen, and White can check the king from the
    opposite direction to win the queen.^[19]
automaton
    An automaton is a self-operating machine. In chess, it refers to
    chess-playing machines that were in fact hoaxes and under the control of
    hidden human players. Automatons stirred up great interest in the 18th and
    19th centuries and inspired early thoughts of the possibility artificial
    intelligence. By far, the most famous chess-playing "automaton" was The
    Turk, whose secret of human control was kept for a very long time. The
    first true automaton El Ajedrecista was created by Leonardo Torres y
    Quevedo.

B[edit]

B
    Symbol used for the bishop when recording chess moves in English.^[20]
back rank
    A player's first rank (the one on which the pieces stand in the starting
    position); White's back rank is Black's eighth rank, and vice versa.^[21]
    Also called first rank or home rank.
back-rank mate
    A checkmate delivered by a rook or queen along a back rank from which the
    mated king is unable to move because it is blocked by friendly pieces
    (usually pawns) on the second rank.^[21] Also called back-row mate.
back-rank weakness
    A situation in which a player is under threat of a back-rank mate and,
    having no time/option to create an escape for the king, must constantly
    watch and defend against that threat, for example by keeping a rook on the
    back rank.^[21]
backward pawn
    A pawn that is behind a pawn of the same color on an adjacent file and that
    cannot be advanced with the support of another pawn.^[22]

    A bishop that is hemmed in by the player's own pawns.^[23] See also good
    bishop.
bare king
    A position in which a king is the only man of its color on the board.^[24]
Basque chess
    A chess competition in which the players simultaneously play each other two
    games on two boards, each playing White on one and Black on the other.
    There is a clock at both boards. It removes the bonus in mini-matches of
    playing White first. Basque chess was first played in the 2012 Donostia
    Chess Festival in the Basque Country, Spain.^[25] Also called Basque System

    action.
battery
    To double rooks on a file, or to place a bishop and a queen on a diagonal.^
    [18] In chess problems, battery refers to an arrangement of two pieces in
    line with the enemy king on a rank, file, or diagonal so that if the middle
    piece moves a discovered check (or a threat other than a check) will be
    delivered.^[26]

    The white bishop is doing the work of a pawn and has no bigger prospects.
big pawn
    A bad bishop stuck behind its own pawns and defending them—effectively
    doing the work of a pawn.^[31]
bind
    A strong grip or stranglehold on a position that is difficult for the
    opponent to break. A bind is usually an advantage in space created by
    advanced pawns. The Maróczy Bind is a well-known example.^[32] See also
    squeeze.
bishop
    Chess bishop icon.png
bishop pair
    The player with two bishops is said to have the bishop pair. Two bishops
    are able to control the diagonals of both colors. In open positions, two
    bishops are considered to have an advantage over two knights, or a knight
    and a bishop.^[18] Also called the two bishops.
bishop pawn
    Or bishop's pawn. A pawn on the bishop's file, i.e. the c-file or f-file.
    Sometimes abbreviated "BP".^[33]
bishops on opposite colors 
    Or bishops of opposite colors. A situation in which one player has only a
    light-square bishop remaining while the other has only a dark-square bishop
    remaining. In endgames, this often results in a draw if there are no other
    pieces (only pawns), even if one side has a material advantage of one, two
    or even three pawns, since the bishops control different squares (see
    Opposite-colored bishops endgame). In the middlegame, however, the presence
    of opposite-colored bishops imbalances the game and can lead to mating
    attacks, since each bishop attacks squares that cannot be covered by the
    other.^[34]
black
    The dark-colored squares on the chessboard are often referred to as "the
    black squares" even though they are often some other dark color. Similarly,
    "the black pieces" are sometimes actually some other (usually dark) color.^
    [35] See also white.
Black
    The designation for the player who moves second, even though the pieces
    ("the black pieces") are sometimes actually some other (usually dark)
    color.^[36] See also White and first-move advantage.
blind chess
    See Kriegspiel.
blindfold chess
    A form of chess in which one or both players are not allowed to see the
    board.^[37]
blind pigs
    A pair of rooks on the opponent's second rank are referred to as "pigs" as
    they tend to devour pawns and pieces, and "blind pigs" if they cannot find
    the mate.^[38]
blitz chess
    [from German: Blitz, "lightning"] A fast form of chess with a very short
    time limit, usually 3 or 5 minutes per player for the entire game. With the
    advent of electronic chess clocks, the time remaining is often incremented
    by 1 or 2 seconds per move.^[39]

    Black has a solid light-square blockade. White's bishop cannot challenge
    Black's minor pieces.
blockade
    The placement of a piece directly in front of an enemy pawn, where it
    obstructs the pawn's advance, and hinders the movements of the other enemy
    pieces. The enemy pawn provides some shelter to the piece that is blocking
    it, thereby protecting it from attacks by enemy pieces. A blockade is most
    effective against passed or isolated pawns. The ideal piece to use as a
    blockader is the knight. This strategy was famously formulated by Aron
    Nimzowitsch in 1924.^[40]^[41]
blocked position
    A position where both sides are constrained from making progress, typically
    by interlocking pawn chain(s) dividing the available space into two camps.^
    [42] See also closed game.
blunder
    A very bad move, an oversight (indicated by "??" in notation).^[18]
board
    1.  See chessboard.
    2.  An assignment in team chess, e.g. first board, second board, etc.

    Boden's Mate
Boden's Mate
    Boden's Mate, named for Samuel Boden, is a checkmate pattern in which the
    king, usually having castled queenside, is checkmated by two crisscrossing
    bishops. Immediately prior to delivering the mate, the winning side
    typically plays a queen sacrifice on c3 or c6 to set up the mating
    position.^[43]
book draw
    An endgame position known to be a draw with perfect play. Historically this
    was established by reference to chess endgame literature, but in simplified
    positions computer analysis in an endgame tablebase can be used.^[44]
book move
    An opening move found in standard reference books on opening theory. A game
    is said to be "in book" when both players are playing moves found in the
    opening references. A game is said to be "out of book" when the players
    have reached the end of the variations analyzed in the opening books, or if
    one of the players deviates with a novelty (or a blunder).^[45]
book win
    An endgame position known to be a win with perfect play. Historically this
    was established by reference to chess endgame literature, but in simplified
    positions (currently seven pieces or fewer) computer analysis in an endgame
    tablebase can be used.^[46]
break
    A move that gains space and therefore freedom of movement, or the opening
    of a blocked position by the advance or capture of a pawn.^[47]
breakthrough
    Penetration of the opponent's position, or destruction of the defense,
    often by means of a sacrifice.^[18]
brevity
    [chiefly British] See miniature.
brilliancy
    A game that contains a spectacular, deep and beautiful strategic idea,
    combination, or original plan.^[47]
brilliancy prize
    A prize awarded at some tournaments for the best brilliancy played in the
    tournament.^[48]
Bronstein delay
    A time control method with time delay, invented by David Bronstein. When it
    becomes a player's turn to move, the clock waits for the delay period
    before starting to subtract from the player's remaining time.^[49]
    [Bughouse_game_animation]
     
    Bughouse chess
bughouse chess
    A popular chess variant played with teams of two or more.^[50]
building a bridge
    Making a path for a king in the endgame by providing protective cover
    against checks from line pieces. A well-known example is the Lucena
    position.^[51]
bullet chess
    Each side has 1 minute to make all their moves.^[52]
bust
    A refutation of an opening, an opening line, a tactic, or a previously
    published analysis.^[53]^[54]
bye
    A tournament round in which a player does not have a game, usually because
    there are an odd number of players. A bye is normally scored as a win (1
    point), although in some tournaments a player is permitted to choose to
    take a bye (usually in the first or last round) and score it as a draw (½
    point).^[54]

C[edit]

[180px-Caissa]
     
    Caïssa, the patron goddess of chess (Fratta, 18th century)
Caïssa
    Known as the goddess or muse of chess, whose name is taken from a nymph in
    a 1763 poem, Caïssa or The Game at Chess, by Sir William Jones.^[55]
calculate
    To plan a series of moves and considering possible responses, without
    actually moving the pieces.^[18]
candidate move
    A move that seems good upon initial observation of the position, and that
    warrants further analysis.^[56]
Candidates Match
    A knockout match in the Candidates Tournament.^[57]
Candidates Tournament
    A tournament organised by the FIDE, the third and last qualifying cycle of
    the World Chess Championship. The participants are the top players of the
    Interzonal tournament plus possibly other players selected on the basis of
    rating or performance in the previous candidates tournament. The top
    ranking player(s) qualify(ies) for the world championship.^[58]
can-opener
    The plan of attacking a kingside, sometimes a fianchetto position, by
    advancing the h-pawn with the intention of opening a file near the
    defender’s king.^[59]
capped piece
    A particular piece with which one player attempts to deliver checkmate.
    Agreeing to play with a capped piece provides the stronger player an extra
    challenge, thereby conferring upon himself a handicap. When the capped
    piece is a pawn, it is called a pion coiffé [from French, "capped pawn"].^
    [60]
capture
    A move by a pawn or piece that removes from the board the opponent’s pawn
    or piece. The capturing piece then occupies the square of the captured
    piece (except in the case of a capture that is done en passant).^[61]
castling
    A move in which the king and a rook are moved at the same time. It moves
    the king from the center to a flank where it usually is safer, and it
    develops the rook. It is the only time two pieces are moved in a turn.
    Castling can be done on either the kingside (notated 0-0) or the queenside
    (0-0-0). Castling cannot be done in reply to a check, nor if either the
    king or rook has already moved.^[62]^[63]
castling into it
    A situation where one side castles and a result is that the king is in more
    danger at the destination than on the initial square, either immediately or
    because lines and diagonals can be more readily opened against it.^[64]
castling long
    Castling queenside; in chess notation: 0-0-0.^[62]
castling short
    Castling kingside; in chess notation: 0-0.^[62]
casual game
    See friendly game.
category of a tournament
    The category of a tournament is a measure of its strength based on the
    average FIDE rating of the participants. The category is calculated by
    rounding up the number: (average rating − 2250) ÷ 25. So each category
    covers a 25-point rating range, starting with Category 1 which spans
    ratings between 2251 and 2275. A Category 18 tournament has an average
    rating between 2676 and 2700.^[65]

    The center squares are marked "×".
center
    Or centre. The four squares in the middle of the board.^[66] See also
    expanded center. Sometimes short for pawn center. A king "in the center"
    can refer to an uncastled king on a center file.
center file 
    Or centre file. The king's file (e-file) or queen's file (d-file).
center pawn 
    Or centre pawn. A pawn on the king's file (e-file) or queen's file
    (d-file).^[67]
central file
    See center file.
centralization
    Moving a piece or pieces toward the center of the board, where they will
    not only control the center, but their influence will extend to other
    areas. Pieces are best placed near the center of the board, because they
    increase their power and maneuverability. Knights in particular benefit
    from being centralized.^[68] Antonym: decentralization.^[69]
central pawn
    See center pawn.
cheapo
    Slang for a primitive trap, often set in the hope of swindling a win or a
    draw from a lost position.^[70] Also called cheap shot.
check
    A direct attack on the king by an enemy man. The attacked king is said to
    be in check. There are only three possible immediate responses to a check:
    capturing the attacking piece, moving the king to an unattacked square, or
    interposing a piece between the attacker and the king. In casual games a
    player usually announces "check", however this is not a requirement in
    tournament games.^[71]
checkmate
    A position in which a player's king is in check and the player has no legal
    move (i.e. cannot move out of or escape the check). A player whose king is
    checkmated loses the game.^[72] Often shortened to mate.
chess blindness
    The failure of a player to see a good move or danger that should normally
    be considered obvious. The term was coined by Siegbert Tarrasch. Similar to
    Kotov syndrome.^[73]
chessboard
    The chequered board used in chess, consisting of 64 squares (eight rows by
    eight columns) arranged in two alternating colors, light and dark.^[74]
    [210px-Sah_sahovska_ura]
     
    A chess clock
chess clock
    A device made up of two adjacent clocks and buttons, keeping track of the
    total time each player takes for their moves. Immediately after moving, the
    player hits their button, which simultaneously stops their clock and starts
    their opponent's. The picture shown displays an analogue clock where the
    term flag fall originates. Modern clocks are digital.^[75]
chessmen
    The movable figures placed on the board in a game of chess. Includes both
    pieces and pawns.^[76] Singular: chessman.
chess notation
    See notation.
chess opening
    See opening.
chess problem
    Also called composition.
    [210px-ChessStartingPosition]
     
    A wooden chess set and board
chess set
    The thirty-two pieces required for a game, plus a chessboard.
chess variant
    A chess-like game played using a board, pieces, or rules different from
    standard chess.^[77]
Chess960
    Chess960 (also known as Fischer Random Chess) is a variation of the game
    invented and advocated by Bobby Fischer. The pieces and pawns have their
    normal moves, but the setup of pieces on the first rank is random, except
    that two rules must be followed: the king must be placed on a square
    between the rooks, and the bishops are placed on squares of opposite color.
    Black's pieces are placed opposite White's. The random setup can be
    established by dice toss, computer program, playing cards, or other
    methods. Castling may be done; the special Chess960 rules governing
    castling incorporate the normal castling in classic chess.^[78]^[79]
chop wood
    Slang for capturing or exchanging pieces.^[80] See also wood.
classical
    1.  An opening system geared towards forming a full pawn center. Classical
    ideas were challenged by hypermodern ideas.^[66]
    2.  A game using a longer time control such as 40/2; the opposite of fast
    chess categories such as rapid, blitz or bullet.^[81]
classical bishop sacrifice
    See Greek gift sacrifice.
clearance
    Removal of piece from a square, rank, file or diagonal so that another
    piece may use it. It often involves sacrificing the piece that unblocked
    the position.^[82]
clock move
    In a game played clock move, a move is considered completed only after the
    clock is pressed. For example, one could touch a piece, then move a
    different piece—as long as the player has not pressed their clock button.
    This way of playing is uncommon but can be seen in casual games or blitz
    games.^[83]
clock time
    Time (consumed or remaining) on the chess clock, in a tournament game.^[84]
closed file
    A file on which White and Black each have a pawn.^[85]
closed game
    A closed game has few open lines (files or diagonals). It is generally
    characterized by interlocking pawn chains, cramped positions with few
    opportunities to exchange, and extensive maneuvering behind lines. Such a
    game may evolve and later become an open game.^[86] See also positional
    play.
Closed Game
    A Closed Game is a particular opening that begins with the moves 1.d4 d5.
    It is also known as a Double Queen's Pawn Opening or Double Queen's Pawn
    Game.^[87] See also Open Game and Semi-Open Game.
closed tournament
    A tournament in which only invited or qualifying players may participate,
    as opposed to an open tournament. Also called invitational tournament.

    The Blackburne Shilling Gambit (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nd4?!), an example
    of coffeehouse play
coffeehouse
    Adjective used to describe a move, player, or style of play characterized
    by risky, positionally dubious play that sets traps for the opponent. The
    name comes from the notion that one would expect to see such play in
    skittles games played in a coffeehouse or similar setting, particularly in
    games played for stakes or blitz chess. The Blackburne Shilling Gambit is a
    typical example of coffeehouse play.^[88]
color
    Or colour. The white or black pieces, and the white or black squares. The
    actual pieces and squares may be other colors, usually light and dark, but
    they are referred to as white and black.^[76] See White and Black in chess.
combination
    A sequence of moves, including forced moves, and often involving a
    sacrifice, to gain an advantage.^[66]
compensation
    That which is gained in return for a sacrifice or some other action. If
    material is sacrificed there may be a gain in development, or if a minor
    piece is exchanged for two or three pawns, the pawns would be the
    compensation.^[89]
computer move
    A term for a move that seems likely to have been played by a computer
    rather than a human, because the move seems counterintuitive, or seems not
    to make immediate sense, or seems to eventually make sense, but not until
    far into the future of the game. Computer moves seem to be what they are:
    moves based on the brute force of millions of calculations, and not based
    on intuition, aesthetics, or emotion. A computer move would overlook a
    dramatic capture that might cause an opponent to resign on the spot in
    favor of an obscure move that may eventually turn out to be only slightly
    better. At one time the term was used disparagingly, but the definition has
    evolved as computers have improved. It is a term that is occasionally used
    to suggest that a player has been assisted by a computer.^[90]^[91]
confirmation bias
    The tendency of a chess player analyzing a position to find a candidate
    move, and then look for variations that support that first move rather than
    looking for superior variations.^[92]
connected passed pawns
    Passed pawns on adjacent files. These are considered to be unusually
    powerful (often worth a minor piece or rook if on the sixth rank or above
    and not properly blockaded) because they can advance together.^[66] See
    also connected pawns.
connected pawns
    Refers to two or more pawns of the same color on adjacent files.^[68] Cf.
    isolated pawns.
connected rooks
    Two rooks of the same color on the same rank or file with no pawns or
    pieces between them. Connected rooks are usually desirable. Players often
    connect rooks on their own first rank or along an open file.^[93] See also
    doubled rooks.
consolidation
    The improvement of a player's position by the reposition of one or more
    pieces to better square(s), typically after a player's attack or
    combination has left their pieces in poor positions or uncoordinated.^[94]
continuation
    See variation.
control
    When a player’s pawn, piece or pieces guard a square, or squares, or a
    file, or a rank in such a way that the territory can be advantageously
    used; and the opponent is prevented from using the territory.^[95]
control of the center
    Having one or more pieces that attack any of the four center squares; an
    important strategy, and one of the main aims of openings.^[96]
cook
    In chess problems, an unintended duplicate solution, or a refutation.^[97]
    See also Glossary of chess problems#cook.
corr.
    An abbreviation for correspondence game.
correspondence chess
    Chess played at a long time control by long-distance correspondence.
    Traditionally correspondence chess was played though the post; today it is
    usually played over a correspondence chess server or by email. Typically,
    one move is transmitted in every correspondence.^[98]
corresponding squares
    Corresponding squares are pairs of squares such that when a king moves to
    one square, it forces the opponent's king to occupy the other square in
    order to hold the position. If the opponent's king cannot move to the
    required square it is zugzwang and a disadvantage. Corresponding squares
    usually occur in pawn endgames. The theory of corresponding squares has
    developed to include complex calculations based on math-like formulas.^[99]
    Also called related squares. Cf. opposition.
counterattack
    An attack that responds to an attack by the opponent.^[100]

    The Falkbeer Countergambit (1.e4 e5 2.f4 d5), a gambit response to the
    King's Gambit
countergambit
    A gambit offered by Black, for example the Greco Counter Gambit, usually
    called the Latvian Gambit today (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f5?!); the Albin
    Countergambit (1.d4 d5 2.c4 e5); and the Falkbeer Countergambit (1.e4 e5
    2.f4 d5). An opening need not have "countergambit" in its name to be one,
    for instance the Benko Gambit (1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 b5); the Englund
    Gambit (1.d4 e5?!); the Budapest Gambit (1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5); the Blackburne
    Shilling Gambit (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nd4?!); and many lines of the Two
    Knights Defense (e.g. 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Ng5 and now 4...Bc5!?
    [the Wilkes–Barre Variation or Traxler Counterattack]; 4...Nxe4?!; 4...d5
    5.exd5 Na5 6.Bb5+ c6 [the main line]; 4...d5 5.exd5 Nd4 [the Fritz
    Variation]; and 4...d5 5.exd5 b5 [the Ulvestad Variation]) are all examples
    of countergambits.^[101]
counterplay
    The defending side's own aggressive action.^[102]
country move
    A disparaging term for a move considered unsophisticated, especially an
    unnecessary single-step advance of the rook's pawn in the opening. The term
    was popular in London in the late 19th century.^[103]
cover
    To protect a piece or control a square.
cramped
    Having limited mobility in a position.^[104]
critical position
    The moment in a game or opening when the evaluation shows that things are
    about to change, either towards an advantage for one player, or towards
    equality; a wrong move can be disastrous.^[102]
critical square
    See key square.
cross-check
    A cross-check is a check played in reply to a check, especially when the
    original check is blocked by a piece that itself either delivers check or
    reveals a discovered check from another piece.^[105]
crosstable
    An arrangement of the results of every game in a tournament in tabular
    form. The names of the players run down the left side of the table in
    numbered rows. The names may be listed in order of results, alphabetically,
    or in pairing order, but results order is most common. The columns are also
    numbered, each one corresponding to the player in the same numbered row.
    Each table cell records the outcome of the game between the players on the
    intersecting row and column, using 1 for a win, 0 for a loss, and ½ for a
    draw. (In a double round-robin tournament each cell contains two entries,
    as each pair of players plays two games alternating White and Black.) Every
    game is recorded twice, once from the perspective of each player. The
    diagonal cells that correspond to the player playing himself are marked
    with a * or × or other symbol since they are not used.^[106] For examples
    see Hastings 1895 chess tournament, Nottingham 1936 chess tournament, and
    AVRO tournament.
crush
    Slang for a quick win, especially an overwhelming attack versus poor
    defensive play. A crushing move is a decisive one.

D[edit]

dark-square bishop 
    One of the two bishops that moves only on the dark squares. In the initial
    position, White's dark-square bishop is on c1; Black's is on f8.^[36] Often
    shortened to dark bishop.^[69] Cf. light-square bishop.
dark squares
    The 32 dark-colored squares on the chessboard, such as a1 and h8. A dark
    square is always located at a player's left-hand corner.^[36] Cf. light
    squares.

    A dead draw by means of insufficient material. King versus king and bishop
    will not ever lead to checkmate.
dead draw
    A drawn position in which neither player has any realistic chance to win. A
    dead draw may refer to a position in which it is impossible for either
    player to win (such as insufficient material), or it may refer to a simple,
    lifeless position that would require a major blunder before either side
    would have a chance to win.^[107]
decoy
    This is a tactic used to lure a piece to a particular square.^[108]
defense 
    1.  A move or plan to meet the opponent's attack.^[102]
    2.  Part of the name of openings played by Black; e.g. the Scandinavian
    Defense, King's Indian Defence, English Defence, etc.^[102]
deflect
    The inverse of a decoy. Whereas a decoy involves luring an enemy piece to a
    bad square, a deflection involves luring an enemy piece away from a good
    square; typically, away from a square on which it defends another piece or
    threat. Deflection is thus closely related to overloading.^[109]

demonstration board
    A large standing chess board used to analyze a game or show a game in
    progress. Johann Löwenthal invented the demonstration board in 1857.^[110]
descriptive notation
    A system of recording chess moves, used primarily in the English and
    Spanish speaking countries until the 1980s. Descriptive notation is based
    on natural language descriptions of chess moves rendered in abbreviated
    form, for example "pawn to queen's bishop's fourth" is rendered as "P-QB4".
    Now replaced by the standard algebraic notation.^[111]
desperado
    A piece that seems determined to give itself up, typically to bring about
    stalemate or perpetual check. Also a threatened piece that sacrifices
    itself for the maximum compensation possible.^[112]
development 
    The movement of non-pawn pieces in the opening from their original squares
    to squares where they can be more active. Development of one's pieces is
    one of the objectives of the opening phase of the game.^[108]
diagonal
    A line of squares of the same color touching corner to corner, along which
    a queen or bishop can move.^[113]
discovered attack
    An attack made by a queen, rook or bishop when another piece or pawn moves
    out of its way.^[108]

    Once the e4-bishop moves, it is discovered check by the rook.
discovered check
    A discovered attack to the king. This occurs when a player moves a piece,
    resulting in another piece putting their opponent's king in check.^[114]
domination
    A situation that occurs in games and in endgame studies when a piece is
    attacked and appears to have a number of destination squares, but the
    squares are guarded and the piece cannot avoid being captured.^[115]
double attack
    Two attacks made with one move: these attacks may be made by the same piece
    (in which case it is a fork); or by different pieces, for example in a
    discovered attack when the moved piece also makes a threat.^[108]
double check
    A check delivered by two pieces at the same time. A double check
    necessarily involves a discovered check. By its nature a double check
    cannot be met by interposing a defending piece in the line of attack, or by
    capturing an attacker; when subjected to a double check, the attacked king
    must move, which makes the double check especially powerful as an attacking
    tactic.^[116]
doubled pawns
    Two pawns of the same color on the same file; generally considered a
    weakness due to their inability to defend each other.^[113]
doubled rooks
    A powerful configuration in which a player's two rooks are placed on the
    same file or rank with no other men between them. They defend each other
    and attack along the shared file or rank, as well as two additional ranks
    or files. The configuration can be especially decisive in the endgame.^
    [117]
draw
    A game that ends without victory for either player. Most drawn games are
    draws by agreement. The other ways that a game can end in a draw are
    stalemate, threefold repetition, the fifty-move rule, and insufficient
    material. A position is said to be a draw (or a "drawn position" or
    "theoretical draw") if either player can, through correct play, eventually
    force the game into a position where the game must end in a draw,
    regardless of the moves made by the other player. A draw is usually scored
    as ½ point, although in some matches only wins are counted and draws are
    ignored.^[108]
draw by agreement
    A game that is ended by both players accepting a draw.^[118] See also
    resign.
draw death
    Hypothetical scenario whereby elite-level chess players, aided by modern
    computer analysis, become so good that they never make mistakes, leading to
    endless drawn games (since chess is widely believed to be drawn with best
    play from both sides).^[119]
drawing line
    An opening variation that commonly ends in a draw.^[120] See also
    Collection of drawing lines.
drawing weapon
    An opening line played with the intent of drawing the game.^[121]
drawish
    An adjective describing a position or game that is likely to end in a draw.

draw odds
    A type of chess handicap where one player (Black in an Armageddon game)
    only has to draw in order to win the match.^[123]
draw offer
    A proposal by a player to the opponent that the game be drawn by agreement.
    ^[124]
dynamism
    A style of play in which the activity of the pieces is favored over more
    positional considerations, even to the point of accepting permanent
    structural or spatial weaknesses. Dynamism stemmed from the teachings of
    the Hypermodern school and challenged the dogma found in more classical
    teachings, such as those put forward by Wilhelm Steinitz and Siegbert
    Tarrasch.^[125]

E[edit]

eat
    To remove the opponent's piece or pawn from the board by taking it with
    one's own piece or pawn.^[126]^[127] See also capture.
ECF
    The English Chess Federation (ECF) is the governing chess organisation in
    England and is one of the federations of the FIDE. It was known as the
    British Chess Federation (BCF) until 2005 when it was renamed.
ECO
    The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings (ECO), a standard and comprehensive
    chess opening reference. Also a classification system (ECO code) for
    openings that assigns an alphanumeric code from A00 to E99 to each opening.
edge
    An edge is a small but meaningful advantage in the position against one's
    opponent. It is often said White has an edge in the starting position,
    since White moves first (see First-move advantage in chess).^[128]
Elo rating system
    The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels
    of chess players, named after Arpad Elo. Since 2012, FIDE publishes a
    monthly international chess rating list using the Elo system.^[129]
endgame
    The third and last phase of the game, when there are few pieces left on the
    board. The endgame follows the middlegame.^[129]
endgame tablebase
    A computerized database of endgames with a small number of pieces,
    providing perfect play for both players, and thus completely solving those
    endgames. By 2012, tablebases have been calculated for all positions with
    up to seven pieces.^[130]

    passant on the next move only. The white pawn is placed on e6, and the
    black pawn on e5 is removed from the board.
en passant
    [from French, "in the act of passing"] The rule that allows a pawn that has
    just advanced two squares to be captured by an enemy pawn that is on the
    same rank and adjacent file. The pawn can be taken as if it had advanced
    only one square. Capturing en passant is possible only on the next move.^

    The pawn on e4 is en prise.
en prise
    [from French, "in a position to be taken",^[132]^[133] often italicized] En
    prise describes a piece or pawn exposed to a material-winning capture by
    the opponent. This is either a hanging piece, an undefended pawn, a piece
    attacked by a less valuable attacker, or a piece or pawn defended
    insufficiently. For instance, 1.e4 Nf6 2.Nf3? leaves White's e-pawn en
    prise.^[134]
epaulette mate
    A checkmate position where the king is blocked on both sides by its own
    rooks.^[135]
EPD
    An abbreviation for Extended Position Description.
equalize 
    Or equalise. To reach a position where the players have equal chances of

    advantage of the first move, the immediate goal for Black is to achieve
    equality.^[136]
escape square
    See flight square.
evaluation 
    Or simply eval. The analysis of a position. A computer or engine evaluation
    is a means of assigning a number value to a position, based not on
    intelligence, but on algorithms, which vary from engine to engine and
    depend on engine strength. Engine evaluations have foibles and
    imperfections even when functioning as designed. If an engine describes a
    position as +2.50, the plus sign (+) indicates the position is favorable to
    White; a minus sign (−) indicates the position is favorable to Black. The
    number can correspond to the approximate value of pieces, although engines
    use other factors besides material. The notation +2.50 indicates that White
    is ahead by two and one-half pawns. The notation +M4 indicates that White
    can force checkmate in four moves.^[137]^[138]^[139] Cf. analysis.
exchange
    To swap or trade pieces by capture. Usually the pieces are of equal value
    (i.e., rook for rook, knight for knight, etc.), or of bishop for knight
    (two pieces that are considered approximately equal in value).^[140] Also
    called even exchange.
exchange, the
    The advantage of a rook over a minor piece (knight or bishop). The player
    who captures a rook for a minor piece is said to have "won the exchange",
    the player who has lost the rook has "lost the exchange". An exchange
    sacrifice is giving up a rook for a minor piece.^[134]
exchange variation
    This is a type of opening in which there is an early, voluntary exchange of
    pawns or pieces.^[141]
exhibition
    Chess games played for the public in various formats and for various
    purposes, often to promote the game, or a particular match or player, or as
    a fundraiser. An exhibition may pit two masters against each other, and
    normally use chess clocks. In a simultaneous exhibition, one player takes
    on a number opponents at once, and it is often not timed. A blindfold
    exhibition is the same but more challenging, since the exhibitor plays
    without seeing the boards.^[142]

    cannot prevent.^[158]
forced move
    A move that is the only one that does not result in a serious disadvantage
    for the moving player. Forced can also be used to describe a sequence of
    moves for which the player has no viable alternative, for example "the
    forced win of a piece" or "a forced checkmate". In these cases the player
    cannot avoid the loss of a piece or checkmate, respectively.^[157]

fork
    A simultaneous attack by a single piece on two (or more) of the opponent's
    pieces (or other direct target, such as a mate threat). When the attacker
    is a knight the tactic is often specifically called a knight fork. Some
    sources state that only a knight can give a fork and that the term double
    attack is correct when another piece is involved, but this is by no means
    universal usage.^[5]
Forsyth–Edwards Notation
    A standard notation for describing a particular board position of a chess
    game. The purpose of FEN notation is to provide all the necessary
    information to restart a game from a particular position.^[161]^[162] Abbr.

    obtained by the side with a material disadvantage, may result in a draw due
    to the stronger side's inability to make progress.^[163]
friendly game
    A game that is not played as part of a match, tournament, or exhibition.
    Often the game is not timed, but if a chess clock is used rapid time
    controls are common. The term refers only to the circumstances in which the
    game is played, not the relationship between the players or the intensity
    of the competition.^[164] Also called casual game.

    squares of color opposite to that of the bishop.^[169] See also bad bishop.
Grandmaster 
    The highest title a chess player can attain (besides World Champion).
    Awarded by FIDE, it cannot be taken away.^[170] Abbr. GM.
grandmaster draw
    A game in which the players agree to a quick draw. Originally it referred
    to such games between grandmasters, but the term can now refer to any such
    game.^[170]
Greek gift sacrifice
    A typical sacrifice of a bishop by White playing Bxh7+ or by Black playing
    ...Bxh2+ against a castled king to initiate a mating attack. Also known as

    en prise.^[170]
hanging pawns
    Two pawns of the same color on adjacent files, with no pawns of the same
    color on the files either side of them. The term is used almost exclusively
    for pawns on the c- and d-files, and usually for two pawns on the same rank
    (side by side). They can be a strength, a weakness or neutral depending on
    the position. They are typically an attacking rather than a defensive
    asset.^[170]
Harry
    A nickname for the h-pawn, sometimes occurring in the expression, "Harry
    the h-pawn".^[173]^[174]
hauptturnier
    German word that is freely translated as "candidates tournament". In the
    early part of the 20th century, it was necessary for the ambitious European
    amateur to win a succession of prizes in small tournaments, before they
    could progress to a higher level of competition. The creation of the
    hauptturnier enabled the process to become more formalized, and they became
    a regular feature of the major German chess congresses. Winning such an
    event conferred the title of 'Master of the German Chess Federation', and
    this, in turn, could be used to gain admittance to prestigious
    international tournaments. Some of the best players in chess history, such
    as Emanuel Lasker and Siegbert Tarrasch, secured their Master titles and
    advanced their chess careers in this way.^[175]

    A tournament organised by the FIDE starting from the 1950s to 1993. It was
    the second qualifying cycle of the World Chess Championship. The
    participants were selected from the top players of the Zonal tournaments.
    The top ranking players qualified for the Candidates Tournament. Since 1998
    the winners of the zonal tournaments have played short matches against each
    other over a few weeks in a knockout-style competition to determine who is
    eligible for the Candidates Tournament.
intuition
    A way of thinking that looks for the winning strategy not by calculating,
    but by a feeling or a hunch, that may be prompted subconsciously while
    studying the position, its visual patterns and dynamics, or by one’s memory
    of previous experience.^[192]
IQP
    An abbreviation for isolated queen pawn. See also isolani.
irregular opening
    In early 19th-century chess literature, all openings that did not begin
    with either 1.e4 e5 or 1.d4 d5 were classified as "irregular". As opening
    theory developed and many openings previously considered "irregular" became
    standard (e.g. the Sicilian Defence), the term gradually became less
    common. Opening books today are more likely to describe debuts such as 1.b4
    (the Sokolsky Opening) as "uncommon" or "unorthodox".^[193]
isolani
    Refers to a d-pawn with no pawns of the same color on the adjacent c-file
    and e-file, and is a synonym for isolated queen pawn (abbr. IQP). The term
    was coined by Nimzowitsch, who considered the isolani as a weapon of attack
    in the middlegame but an endgame weakness; he considered the problem of
    hanging pawns to be related.^[194] See also Pawn structure#Queen's Gambit –
    Isolani.
isolated pawn
    A pawn with no pawn of the same color on an adjacent file.^[195]

    Italian bishops in the Giuoco Piano
Italian bishop
    A white bishop developed to c4 or a black bishop developed to c5. A bishop
    so developed is characteristic of the Italian Game. In the Giuoco Piano
    both players have Italian bishops. The Italian bishop stands in contrast to
    the "Spanish" bishop on b5 characteristic of the Ruy Lopez. "Italian" may
    be used as an adjective for an opening where one or both players have
    Italian bishops.^[196]

J[edit]

j'adoube
    (from French, "I adjust", pronounced [ʒa.dub]) See Touch-move rule. A
    player says "j'adoube" as the international signal that he or she intends
    to adjust the position of a piece on the board without being subject to the
    touched piece rule. The verb adouber, literally "to dub" (raise to the
    knighthood) is rarely used in contemporary French outside of this context.
    A local language equivalent, e.g. "I am adjusting" is generally acceptable.

    Symbol used for the king when recording chess moves in English.^[20]
key square
    1.  An important square.

kibitz
    As a spectator, making comments on a chess game that can be heard by the
    players. Kibitzing on a serious game while it is in progress (rather than
    during a post-mortem) is a serious breach of chess etiquette.^[197]
kick
    Attacking a piece, often a knight, with a pawn, so that it will move.
    Kicking a piece may lead to gaining a tempo, or may force the opponent to
    concede control of key squares.^[197]

    game. The terms king knight and king rook are also used. Sometimes
    abbreviated "KB", "KN", and "KR", respectively.^[76]
king hunt
    A sustained attack on the enemy king that results in the king being driven
    a far distance from its initial position, typically resulting in its
    checkmate. Some of the most famous games featuring king hunts are Edward
    Lasker–Thomas, Polugaevsky–Nezhmetdinov, and Kasparov–Topalov.^[198]
king knight
    Or king's knight. The knight that is on the kingside at the start of the
    game. The terms king bishop and king rook are also used. Sometimes
    abbreviated "KN", "KB", and "KR", respectively.^[76]
king pawn
    Or king's pawn. A pawn on the king's file, i.e. the e-file. Sometimes
    abbreviated "KP". Also king bishop pawn (KBP), king knight pawn (KNP), and
    king rook pawn (KRP) for a pawn on the f-, g-, or h-file, respectively.^
    [76]
king pawn opening
    An opening that begins 1.e4. Also called king's pawn opening.
king rook
    Or king's rook. The rook that is on the kingside at the start of the game.
    The terms king bishop and king knight are also used. Sometimes abbreviated
    "KR", "KB", and "KN", respectively.^[76]
kingside
    Or king's side. The side of the board (half-board) the kings are on at the
    start of the game (the e- through h-file), as opposed to the queenside.^
    [33] Also called king's wing.
king walk
    A consecutive series of king moves designed to bring the king to a safer
    square. For example, if a player has castled kingside but the opponent has
    sacrificed a piece to destroy the kingside pawn cover, they may choose to
    walk the king over to the queenside to shelter behind the queenside pawns.^
    [199] See also King walk.

    Example of a knight's tour
knight's tour
    A puzzle that challenges a person to set a knight on an empty chessboard,
    and make the piece move around (as it moves in a chess game), but to visit
    every square only once. The knight’s tour is the most well known of a
    variety of “tours” and puzzles based on chess pieces. A "closed" tour (also
    known as a "re-entrant tour") ends on the same square on which it began and
    needs 64 moves. An "open" tour ends on a different square and needs only 63
    moves.^[200]
knockout tournament
    See Single-elimination tournament. A tournament conducted as a series of
    matches in which the winner of each match advances to the next round and
    the loser is eliminated. Well-known chess tournaments held in the knockout
    format include London 1851 and the 2007 Chess World Cup. Cf. round-robin
    tournament and Swiss tournament.
Kotov syndrome
    This phenomenon, described by Alexander Kotov in his 1971 book Think Like a
    Grandmaster, can occur when a player does not find a good plan after
    thinking long and hard on a position. The player, under time pressure, then
    suddenly decides to make a move that he has hardly thought about at all,
    and it may not be a good move for that reason.^[201]
Kriegspiel
    [from German, "war game"] Kriegspiel is a chess variant played by two
    opponents who can only see their own board, and one monitoring umpire who
    makes the moves of both players on a neutral board. It requires three chess
    sets and boards. The players make their moves based on limited information
    from the umpire. It was introduced in 1898. It is sometimes referred to as
    blind chess, not be confused with blindfold chess.^[202]
Kt
    The symbol sometimes used for the knight when recording chess moves in
    descriptive notation, mainly in older literature. An N is used instead in
    algebraic notation and in later descriptive notation to avoid confusion
    with K, the symbol for the king.^[20]

    pieces are uncoordinated.
losing a tempo
    See tempo.
loss
    A defeat for one of the two players, which may occur due to that player
    being checkmated by the other player, resigning, exceeding the time control
    , or being forfeited by the tournament director. In chess, a zero-sum game,
    this results in a win for the other player.^[210]

Lucena position
    A well-known rook and pawn versus rook endgame position in which the player
    with the extra pawn can force a win by cutting off the opponent's king and
    placing a rook on the 4th rank in order to block the opponent's rook
    checks, thereby allowing the pawn to queen.^[51]
luft
    [from German, "air"] Space made for a castled king to give it a flight
    square to prevent a back-rank mate. Usually luft is made by moving a pawn
    on the second rank in front of the king.^[211] See also flight square.

main line
    The principal, most important, or most often played variation of an
    opening.^[212]

    opponent's; often a player with a majority on one flank has a minority on
    the other.^[213]
major piece
    A queen or rook, also known as a heavy piece.^[214] The primary distinction
    of major pieces versus minor pieces is that major pieces are capable of
    checkmate with only their own king for support, as the enemy king is unable
    to step across the ranks and files they control. On an otherwise empty
    board, a major piece can move from any square to any other square in at
    most two moves.
man
    A piece or a pawn, when the term piece is used as exclusive of pawns.^[215]

Maróczy Bind
    A bind on the light squares in the center, particularly d5, obtained by
    White by placing pawns on c4 and e4. Named for Géza Maróczy, it originally
    referred to formations arising in some variations of the Sicilian Defence,
    but the name is now also applied to similar setups in the English Opening
    and the Queen's Indian Defense. It was once greatly feared by Black but
    means of countering it have been developed since the 1980s and earlier.^
    [216]
master
    Loosely, a strong chess player who would be expected to beat most amateurs.
    It may also refer to a formal title such as International Master or
    National Master. Standards vary, but a master will usually have an Elo
    rating of over 2200.^[217]
match
    A competition between two individuals or two teams. A match may be the
    entire competition, or it may be a round in a knockout tournament or team
    tournament. A chess match always consists of at least two games, and often
    many more.^[217]
mate
    Short for checkmate.^[218]
material
    All of a player's pieces and pawns on the board. The player with pieces and
    pawns of greater value is said to have a "material advantage". When a
    player gains a material advantage they are also said to be "winning
    material".^[219] See Chess piece relative value.
materialism
    Playstyle characterised by a willingness to win material at the expense of
    positional considerations. Chess computers are often materialistic.^[220]
mating attack

    is also given, as in MCO-14, the 14th edition. Cf. ECO.
middlegame
    The part of a chess game that follows the opening and comes before the
    endgame, beginning after the pieces are developed in the opening. This is
    usually roughly moves 20 through 40.^[219]
miniature
    A short game (usually no more than 20 to 25 moves), for example: 1.e3 e5
    2.Qf3 d5 3.Nc3 e4 4.Qf4?? Bd6! and White resigned in Spiel–Künzel, Europe
    1900,^[222] because the queen is trapped. However, a significant minority
    of authors include games up to 30 moves.^[223] Usually only decisive games
    (not draws) are considered miniatures. Ideally, a miniature should not be
    spoiled by an obvious blunder by the losing side. A miniature may also
    qualify as a brilliancy. The Opera Game is a famous example. Sometimes
    called a brevity [chiefly British].^[48] See also Glossary of chess
    problems#miniature.
minor exchange
    The exchange of a bishop for a knight.^[224]
minority attack
    An advance of pawns on the side of the board where one has fewer pawns than
    the opponent, usually carried out to provoke a weakness.^[219]
minor piece
    A bishop or knight.^[219] Unlike major pieces, minor pieces are unable to
    contain the enemy king or block his advance alone, as he can simply pass
    through the holes in their line of attack. Compared to major pieces, minor
    pieces also find it difficult to navigate the entire board; a knight may
    require four moves to reach a square two squares away, while a bishop can
    only ever control half of all squares.
mobile pawn center
    Pawns on central squares able to advance without becoming weak.^[225]
mobility
    The ability of a piece(s) to move around the board. Having space.^[219]

    chess on the Internet, that results in an unintended move.^[226]
move
    A full move is a turn by both players, White and Black. A turn by either
    White or Black is a half-move, or (in computer context) one ply.^[227]
move order
    The sequence of moves one chooses to play an opening or execute a plan.
    Different move orders often have different advantages and disadvantages. A
    plan that uses certain moves, can sometimes be improved by making the
    identical moves but in a different sequence.^[228] See also transposition.
mysterious rook move
    Coined by Nimzowitsch to refer to the placing of a rook on a closed file in
    anticipation that the opponent is going to open the file. This move may
    either achieve a position with a rook on an open file, or it may
    alternatively hinder the opponent's intentions (prophylaxis). The meaning
    of the word has since expanded to refer to any rook move that appears to
    have a hidden purpose.^[229]^[230]

N[edit]

N
    1.  Symbol used for the knight when recording chess moves in English.
    2.  An abbreviation for novelty.
NCO
    An abbreviation sometimes used for the chess opening reference Nunn's Chess
    Openings. Cf. ECO and MCO.
NN
    Traditionally used in game scores to indicate a player whose name is not
    known. The origin is uncertain. It may be an abbreviation of the Latin
    nomina ("names"), or it may be short for the Latin phrase nomen nescio
    ("name unknown").^[231]
norm
    A standard of competitive performance that is required in order for a chess
    player to be awarded one of several titles, such as Grandmaster,
    International Master, or Woman Grandmaster, etc. The chess organization,
    such as FIDE, that awards the titles, will establish specifically what a
    norm is. For example a candidate might achieve a norm if they play in a
    tournament and face a certain number of grandmasters, and then have a
    certain number of wins in that tournament against players that are above a
    certain rating, and so on. If the candidate then collects a certain number
    of norms, three for example, they will win a grandmaster title. The details
    that define a norm can be obtained from the chess organization, and the
    details will change from time to time.^[232]^[233]
notation
    Any method of recording chess moves, allowing games to be later published,
    replayed and analyzed. The most common notation today is algebraic notation
    , which is used internationally. Formerly descriptive notation was standard
    in English language publications. There are also systems of notation for
    recording chess positions without the use of diagrams, the most common of
    which is Forsyth–Edwards Notation (FEN).^[234]
novelty
    See theoretical novelty.

occupation
    Occupation of a rank or file means a rook or queen controls it; occupation
    of a square means a piece or pawn sits on it.^[235]^[236]
octopus
    A strongly positioned knight in enemy territory. A knight on e6 reaches out
    in eight directions, like the eight tentacles of an octopus.^[237]
odds
    This refers to the stronger player giving the weaker player some sort of
    advantage in order to make the game more competitive. It may be an
    advantage in material, in extra moves, in time on the clock, or some
    combination of those elements. Since the advent of the chess clock, time
    odds have become more common than material odds.^[238]

open file
    A file on which there are no pawns. A file on which only one player has
    pawns is said to be half-open.^[5]
open game
    A game in which exchanges have opened files and diagonals, and there are
    few pawns in the center, as opposed to a closed game.^[240]
Open Game
    Any opening that begins with the moves 1.e4 e5. Examples of Open Games
    include the Ruy Lopez, the Giuoco Piano, the Danish Gambit, and many
    others. The Open Game is also referred to as a Double King's Pawn Opening
    or Double King's Pawn Game.
opening
    The beginning phase of the game, roughly the first dozen moves, but it can
    extend much farther. In the opening players set up their pawn structures,
    develop their pieces, and usually castle. The opening precedes the
    middlegame.^[240]
opening innovation
    A synonym for theoretical novelty.
opening preparation
    Home study and analysis of openings and defenses that one expects to play,
    or meet, in later tournament or match games. In high-level play, an
    important part of this is the search for theoretical novelties that improve
    upon previous play or previously published analysis.^[241]
opening repertoire
    The set of openings played by a particular player. The breadth of different
    players' repertoires varies from very narrow to very broad.^[242]
opening system
    An opening that is defined by one player's moves and that can be played
    generally regardless of the moves of the opponent, with the goal of
    reaching a desired type of middlegame position. Sometimes several different
    move orders are possible. Examples include the Colle System and
    Hippopotamus Defence.^[243]
open lines
    noun. Unobstructed files and diagonals. See also open game. verb. To move
    or exchange pawns to bring about unobstructed files and diagonals.
open tournament
    A tournament where anyone can enter, regardless of rating or invitation.^

opposite-colored bishops 
    See bishops on opposite colors.
opposition
    A position in which two kings stand on the same rank, file or diagonal with
    one empty square between them. The player to move may be forced to move the
    king to a less advantageous square. Opposition is a particularly important
    concept in endgames.^[245] One orthogonal square separation is direct
    opposition; one diagonal square is diagonal opposition; multiple squares
    separation is distant opposition. Cf. corresponding squares.
optimal play
    See Best response. Both sides playing their best move at each turn, or one
    of equally good alternatives. One side tries to win as quickly as possible
    while the other side tries to delay it as long as possible, or optimal play
    may result in a draw. Cf. Solved game#Perfect play.
OTB
    An abbreviation for over the board.^[246]
outpost
    An outpost is a square protected by a pawn that is in or near the enemy's
    stronghold. Outposts are a favorable position from which one can launch an
    attack, particularly using a knight.^[247]
outside passed pawn
    A passed pawn near the edge of the board and not in the path of threats
    from the opponent's pawns. In the endgame, such a pawn can constitute a
    strong advantage, because it threatens to promote, and it also diverts the
    opponent's forces to restrain its advance.^[248]
overextended
    An overextended position results when a player has advanced pawns too far
    into his opponent's side without sufficient support. The premature advance
    can leave weaknesses in the player's camp or the advanced pawns themselves
    may be weak ("overextended pawns").^[249]
overloaded
    A piece that has too many defensive duties. An overloaded piece can
    sometimes be deflected, or required to abandon one of its defensive duties.
    ^[250]
overprotection
    The strategy of protecting an important pawn or square more than is
    apparently necessary. This serves to dissuade the opponent from attacking
    that point, and the latent power of the "over protectors" assembled around
    an important point, is a significant threat that can bear fruit at a small
    tactical change in the position. Aron Nimzowitsch coined the term and was a
    proponent of overprotection.^[251]
over the board 
    1.  A game played face-to-face with the opponent, as opposed to a remote
    opponent as in online chess or correspondence chess.
    2.  Analysis carried out during a game in real time (not necessarily a
    face-to-face game) as opposed to during preparation. Finding accurate moves
    over the board is harder than finding them with computer assistance in
    one's own time. "I looked up the gambit Smith played and there's a line
    that refutes it, but I couldn't find it over the board."^[246]
    Abbr. OTB.
overworked
    A synonym for overloaded.^[252]

pattern recognition
    A part of chess thinking that involves remembering and recognizing certain
    recurring aspects large and small, visual and dynamic. It is a kind of
    thinking that gives an advantage to a player with great experience. It is
    distinct from the intellectual activity of calculation. It uses intuitive
    thinking that is familiar to humans, but is foreign to computers. It can be
    developed by studying chess puzzles. It has been studied by Adriaan de
    Groot, and other scientists, who have attempted to discover how chess
    players think.^[255]^[256]

pawn center
    Or pawn centre. A player's pawns in the center of the board. Pawns on the
    squares adjacent to the center may also be considered part of the pawn
    center. Having a strong pawn center was considered absolutely essential
    until the hypermodernist school introduced some new ideas.^[259] Often
    shortened to center. See King's Indian Defence, Four Pawns Attack for an
    example of an opening leading to an extended pawn center.
pawn chain
    Two or more pawns of the same color diagonally linked. A pawn chain’s
    weakest point is the base, because it is not protected by another pawn.^

    Black has three pawn islands and White has two. The pawn on e5 is not
    isolated because it is adjacent a file that has a white pawn.
pawn island
    A group of pawns of one color on consecutive files with no other pawns of
    the same color on an adjacent file. A pawn island consisting of one pawn is
    an isolated pawn.^[260]
pawn majority
    See majority.
pawn race
    A situation where both opponents are pushing a passed pawn in effort to be
    first to promote.
pawn roller

    another as they advance toward promotion.
pawn skeleton
    See pawn structure.
pawn storm
    An attacking technique where a group of pawns on one wing is advanced to
    break up the defense.^[261]
pawn structure
    The placement of the pawns during the course of a game. As pawns are the
    least mobile of the pieces and the only pieces unable to move backwards,
    the position of the pawns greatly influences the character of the game.^
    [262] Also called pawn skeleton.
PCA
    An abbreviation for the Professional Chess Association.
performance rating
    A number reflecting the approximate rating level at which a player
    performed in a particular tournament or match. It is often calculated by
    adding together the player's performances in each individual game, using
    the opponent's rating for a draw, adding 400 points to the opponent's
    rating for a win, and subtracting 400 points from the opponent's rating for
    a loss, then dividing by the total number of games. For example, a player
    who beat a 2400-rated player, lost to a 2600, drew a 2500, and beat a 2300,
    would have a performance rating of 2550 (i.e. 2800 + 2200 + 2500 + 2700,
    divided by 4).^[263]
perpetual check
    When a player puts the opponent in check, and the check could be repeated
    endlessly, the game will be declared a draw by repetition. This tactic can
    be resorted to as a form of insurance in a losing position.^[264] Often
    shortened to perpetual.

Philidor position
    Usually refers to an important chess endgame that illustrates a drawing
    technique when the defender has a king and rook versus a king, rook, and
    pawn. It is also known as the third rank defense, because of the importance
    of the rook on the third rank cutting off the opposing king. It was
    analyzed by Philidor in 1777.^[266] See also Rook and pawn versus rook
    endgame.
piece
    1.  One of the chessmen or figures used to play the game—king, queen, rook,
    bishop, knight or pawn. Each piece type has its own rules of movement on
    the board. This is the definition used in the context of the rules of chess
    , for example the touched piece rule.
    2.  When annotating or discussing chess games, the term "piece" usually
    excludes pawns. It may be used collectively for all "non-pawns", for
    example "White's pieces are well posted". In some contexts, it may refer
    specifically to a minor piece, for example "I hung a piece" or "I
    sacrificed a piece for two pawns".^[267]
pin
    When a piece is attacked but cannot legally move, because doing so would
    expose the player's own king to the attack; or when a piece is attacked and
    can legally move out of the line of attack, but such a move would expose a
    more valuable piece (or an unprotected piece) to capture.^[227] See
    absolute pin and relative pin, respectively.
plan
    A strategy employed in a specific position to optimize a player's
    advantages while minimizing the impact of positional disadvantages.
playable
    Said of an opening, a position, or move that gives the person playing it a
    tenable position.^[268]
play by hand
    To make a move intuitively and without analyzing the move.^[269]
ply
    Term mainly used in computer chess to denote one play of either White or
    Black. Thus equal to half a move.

positional player
    A player who specializes in positional play, as distinguished from a

positional sacrifice
    A sacrifice in which the lost material is not regained via a combination,

    as a true sacrifice, as opposed to a pseudo sacrifice or sham sacrifice.
post mortem
    Analysis of a game after it has concluded, typically by one or both players

priyome
    A Russian term for particular tactics that depend on pawn structure.^[273]
problem-like
    An elegant and counterintuitive tactical shot, of the type generally found
    in chess problems rather than in actual play, can be termed problem-like.

    or knight. Promotion to a piece other than a queen is called underpromotion
    .^[227]

    White ranks are indicated at the left (a-file); Black ranks are indicated
    at the right (h-file).
rank
    A row of the chessboard. In algebraic notation, ranks are numbered 1–8
    starting from White's side of the board; however, players customarily refer
    to ranks from their own perspectives. For example: White's king and other
    pieces start on his or her first (or "back") rank, whereas Black calls the
    same rank the eighth rank; White's seventh rank is Black's second; and so
    on. If neither perspective is given, White's view is assumed. This relative
    reference to ranks was formalized in the older descriptive notation.^[284]
rapid chess
    A form of chess with reduced time limit, usually 30 minutes per player.
recapture
    The capture of an opponent's piece that previously made a capture, and
    usually played immediately following the opponent's capture move. The
    capture and recapture occur on the same square, and usually the pieces
    captured and recaptured have the same value.
refute
    To demonstrate that a strategy, move, or opening is not as good as
    previously thought (often, that it leads to a loss), or that previously
    published analysis is unsound. A refutation is sometimes colloquially
    referred to as a bust. A refutation in the context of chess problems or
    endgame studies is often called a cook.^[285]
related squares
    See corresponding squares.
relative pin
    A pin where it is legal to move the pinned piece out of the line of attack.
    Contrast with absolute pin where the pinned piece is not permitted to move
    because it would expose the king to check.
remis
    (French) a draw. It literally means "reset" and is somewhat archaic (the
    usual word for a draw in modern French is nulle) but is internationally
    understood and may be used between players without a common language.
repertoire
    See opening repertoire.
reserve tempo
    A move a player has available. Such a move may not be crucial to the
    position on the board, but being able to force the opponent to move by
    making a reserve move can on occasion result in a significant advantage.^
    [286]
resign 
    To concede loss of the game. A resignation is usually indicated by stopping
    the clocks, sometimes by offering a handshake, or by saying "I resign". A
    traditional way to resign was by tipping over one's king, but this is not
    done nowadays. It is common for a game to be resigned, rather than for it
    to end with checkmate, because experienced players can foresee the
    checkmate.^[287]^[288]
resign on time
    A player who in a hopeless position intentionally runs out of time to avoid
    having to resign can be said to have resigned on time. This is usually
    performed in a more subtle manner than that of Curt von Bardeleben walking
    out of the tournament hall against Wilhelm Steinitz. A player low on time
    and in a losing position may simply "forget" to pay any attention to the
    clock.
Romantic chess
    Romantic chess was the style of chess prevalent in the 19th century. It is
    characterized by bold attacks and sacrifices.^[289]
rook
    Chess rook icon.png
rook lift
    A maneuver that places a rook in front of its own pawns, often on the third
    or fourth rank. This can allow the rook to treat a half-open file as if it
    were an open file, or a closed file as if it were half-open.^[290]
rook pawn
    Or rook's pawn. A pawn on the rook's file, i.e. the a-file or h-file.
    Sometimes abbreviated "RP".^[76]
round-robin tournament
    This is a tournament in which each participant plays every other
    participant an equal number of times. In a double round-robin tournament
    the participants play each other exactly twice, once with white and once
    with black. A round robin tournament is commonly used if the number of
    participants is relatively small.^[291] See also Swiss tournament.
royal fork
    A fork threatening the king and queen.^[292]
royal piece
    A king or queen.^[76] In chess variants, the term refers to any piece that

    A checkmate delivered by a knight in which the mated king is unable to
    escape because it is surrounded (or smothered) by its own pieces.^[304]
Sofia rules
    In the tournament played by Sofia rules, players are not allowed to draw by
    agreement. They could have draws by stalemate, threefold repetition,
    fifty-move rule, or insufficient material. Other draws are allowed only if
    the arbiter declares the game reached a drawn position.^[305]
solid

    This Scotch Opening position contains tension due to the knights on c6 and
    d4. Both knights are currently adequately defended, so neither player is
    forced to release the tension.
tension
    A position in which there are one or more exchanges possible, such as a
    pair of pawns facing each other on a diagonal where either can capture the
    other, is said to contain tension. Such a situation differs from a threat
    in that it does not need to be immediately resolved – for example, if both
    pawns are defended. The consequences of resolving the tension must be
    constantly considered by both players, in case there is a possibility of
    winning or losing material. This makes calculating the best move more
    complicated, and so there is a natural temptation to release the tension by
    making a like-for-like exchange (see simplification) or by moving the
    attacked piece. To keep the tension is to avoid resolving it, which is
    sometimes good advice depending on the position.
text move
    This term is used in written analysis of chess games to refer to a move
    actually played in the game as opposed to other possible moves. Often
    shortened to text, for example "The text is inferior as it allows ...f5."
    Text moves are usually in bold whereas analysis moves are not.
thematic
    Suited to the demands of the position. The term "thematic move" is often
    applied to the key move of a thematic plan.^[317]
theme tournament
    A chess tournament in which every game must begin with a particular opening
    specified by the organizers, for example the Budapest Gambit (1.d4 Nf6 2.c4
    e5).
theoretical draw
    See book draw.
theoretical novelty 
    A move in the opening that has not been played before.^[318] Abbr. TN or N.
threat
    A plan or move that carries an intention to damage the opponent's position.
    A threat is a tactical weapon that must be defended against.^[319]
threefold repetition
    A draw may be claimed if the same position occurs three times with the same
    player to move; and with each player having the choice of the same set of
    moves each time, including the right to capture en passant and the right to
    castle.^[320]
tiebreaks
    See Tie-breaking in Swiss-system tournaments. This refers to a number of
    different systems that are used to break ties, and thus designate a single
    winner, where multiple players or teams tie for the same place in a Swiss
    system chess tournament.
time
    1.  In chess "time" refers to the amount of time each player has to think
    and calculate as measured by a chess clock.
    2.  The number of moves to complete an objective; for example, if a king is
    racing to stop a pawn from queening, and the king has too few moves, that
    may be referred to as "not enough time".^[309] See also tempo.
time control
    The allowed time to play a game, usually measured by a chess clock. A time
    control can require either a certain number of moves be made per time
    period (e.g. 40 moves in 2½ hours) or it can limit the length of the entire
    game (e.g. 5 minutes per game for blitz). Hybrid schemes are used, and time
    delay controls have become popular since the widespread use of digital
    clocks.^[81]
time delay
    A time control that makes it possible for a player to avoid having an
    ever-decreasing amount of time remaining (as is the case with sudden death
    ). The most important time delays in chess are Bronstein delay and Fischer
    delay.
time pressure
    Also called time trouble. Having very little time on one's clock
    (especially less than five minutes) to complete one's remaining moves. See
    time control.
TN
    An abbreviation for theoretical novelty.
top board
    See first board.
touched piece rule
    Also called touch-move rule. The rule that requires a player who touches a
    piece to move that piece unless the piece has no legal moves. If a player
    moves a piece to a particular square and takes their hand off it, the move
    must be to that square if it is a legal move. Castling must be initiated by
    moving the king first, so a player who touches their rook may be required
    to move the rook, without castling. The rule also requires a player who
    touches an opponent's piece to capture it if possible. In order to adjust
    the position of a piece within its square without being required to move
    it, the player should say "J'adoube" or "I adjust".^[319]

tournament
    A competition involving more than two players or teams, generally played at
    a single venue (or series of venues) in a relatively short period of time.
    A tournament is divided into rounds, with each round consisting either of
    individual games or matches in the case of knockout tournaments and team
    tournaments. The assignment of opponents is called pairing, with the most
    popular systems being round-robin and Swiss. Tournaments are usually
    referred to by combining the city in which they were played with the year,
    as in "London 1851", although there are well-known exceptions, such as "
    AVRO 1938".
tournament book
    A book recording the scores of all the games in a tournament, usually with
    analysis of the best or most important games and some background on the
    event and its participants. One well-known example is Bronstein's Zurich
    International Chess Tournament 1953. The less comprehensive tournament
    bulletin is usually issued between the rounds of a prestigious event,
    giving the players and world media an instant record of the games of the
    previous round. Individual copies may be bundled together at the conclusion
    of the event to provide an inexpensive alternative to the tournament book.^

    attacker and the target. This allows the piece that was formerly pinned to
    move.
unsound
    Antonym of sound.
USCF

V[edit]

vacating sacrifice
    A sacrifice made for the purpose of clearing a square for a different piece
    of the same color.
valve
    A move that opens one line and closes another.
vanished center
    Or vanished centre. A position with no white or black center pawns.^[329]
variant
    See chess variant.
variation
    1.  A sequence of moves or an alternative line of play, often applied to
    the opening. A variation does not have to have been played in a game, it
    may also be a possibility that occurs only in analysis.^[322] Also called
    continuation.
    2.  The word Variation is also used to name specific sequences of moves
    within an opening. For an example, the Dragon Variation is part of the
    Sicilian Defence.^[77]
vertical line
    See file.

W[edit]

waiting move
    A move that makes no threats except that it puts the obligation to move on
    the opponent. A waiting move is effective when the opponent has nothing but
    bad moves available (i.e. is in zugzwang).^[330]
WCC
    An abbreviation for the World Chess Championship.^[331]
weakness
    A pawn or square that can be attacked and is hard to defend.^[332]
weak square
    A square that cannot be easily defended from attack by an opponent. Often a
    weak square is unable to be defended by pawns (a hole) and can be
    theoretically occupied by a piece. Exchange or loss of a bishop may make
    all squares of that bishop's color weak resulting in a "weak square
    complex" on the light squares or the dark squares.^[333]
WFM
    An abbreviation for the Woman FIDE Master title.^[334]
WGM
    An abbreviation for the Woman Grandmaster title.^[334]
white
    The light-colored squares on the chessboard are often referred to as "the
    white squares" even though they often are some other light color.
    Similarly, "the white pieces" are sometimes actually some other (usually
    light) color.^[35] See also black.
White
    The designation for the player who moves first, even though the
    corresponding pieces, referred to as "the white pieces", are sometimes
    actually some other (usually light) color. See also Black and first-move
    advantage.
WIM
    An abbreviation for the Woman International Master title.^[335]
win
    A victory for one of the two players in a game, which may occur due to
    checkmate, resignation by the other player, the other player exceeding the
    time control, or the other player being forfeited by the tournament
    director. Chess being a zero-sum game, this results in a loss for the other
    player. In a tournament a bye may be scored as a win.^[336] See winning
    position.
windmill
    A combination in which two pieces work together to deliver an alternating
    series of checks and discovered checks in such a way that the opposing king
    is required to move on each turn. It is a potent technique, since, on every
    other move, the discovered check may allow the non-checking piece to
    capture an enemy piece without losing a tempo. The most famous example is
    Torre–Lasker, Moscow 1925.^[337] Also called seesaw.
wing
    The queenside a-, b-, and c-files; or the kingside f-, g-, and h-files.^
    [338] Also called flank.
Wing Gambit
    The name given to variations of several openings in which one player
    gambits a wing pawn, usually the b-pawn.^[339]
winning percentage
    A number calculated by adding together the number of games won and half of
    the number of games drawn, (ignoring the losses) then dividing that total
    by the total number of games that were played. Another way of calculating
    the winning percentage is by taking the percentage of games won by a player
    plus half the percentage of drawn games. Thus, if out of 100 games a player
    wins 40 percent, draws 32 percent, and loses 28 percent, the winning
    percentage is 40 plus half of 32, i.e. 56 percent.^[340]
winning position
    A position is said to be a winning if one specified side, with correct
    play, can eventually force a checkmate against any defense (i.e. perfect
    defense).^[341] Also called won game.
Woman FIDE Master
    A women-only chess title ranking below Woman International Master.^[334]
    Abbr. WFM.
Woman Grandmaster
    The highest ranking gender-restricted chess title except for Women's World
    Champion.^[334] Abbr. WGM.
Woman International Master
    A women-only chess title ranking below Woman Grandmaster and above Woman
    FIDE Master.^[334] Abbr. WIM.
won game
    See winning position.
wood
    Slang for pieces. "A lot of wood came off the board" conveys that several
    piece exchanges occurred.^[80]
woodpusher
    A weak chess player, also referred to as a patzer or duffer. Colloquial,
    typically derogatory.^[342]
World Champion
    A winner of the World Chess Championship.^[331]
wrong-colored bishop
    See wrong rook pawn.^[343]
wrong rook pawn
    With a bishop, a rook pawn may be the wrong rook pawn, depending on whether
    or not the bishop controls its promotion square.^[344]

      a b c d e f g  h
    An example of an X-ray defense: The white queen has just put the king in
    check, and the white rook provides an X-ray defense of the white queen.
X-ray
    When the power of a piece, either to attack or to defend, seems to pass
    through an intervening enemy piece. The X-ray attack, also known as a
    skewer, involves two pieces of the same color both caught in the same line
    of attack along a diagonal, rank, or file. The attacking piece forces the
    first and more valuable piece to move out of the way, which allows the
    second piece to be captured. As a defensive tactic the X-ray occurs when
    one piece is defended by another piece, through an attacking enemy piece
    standing between the two.^[345]

Z[edit]

zeitnot
    [from German, "time crisis"] Having very little time on the clock to
    complete the remaining moves of a timed game.^[346] Synonyms: time pressure
    and time trouble.
Zonal tournaments 
    Tournaments organised by FIDE, the first qualifying cycle of the World
    Chess Championship. Each zonal tournament features top players of a certain
    geographical zone. Up until 1993 the winners went on to Interzonal
    tournaments. This was replaced by a system where the winners now play each
    other in knockout-style competitions to determine who goes on to the
    Candidates Tournament.^[347]

    A position of mutual zugzwang (which is also called Trébuchet). Either
    White or Black to move will lead to their pawn being captured.
zugzwang
    [from German, "compulsion to move"] When a player is put at a disadvantage
    by having to make a move; where any legal move weakens the position.
    Zugzwang usually occurs in the endgame, and rarely in the middlegame.^[348]
zwischenschach
    [from German, "in-between check"] Playing a surprising check that your
    opponent didn’t consider when he was plotting a sequence of moves; a
    zwischenzug that is a check.^[349]
zwischenzug
    [from German, "in-between move"] An "inbetween" move, or an intermezzo,
    played before an expected reply. Often, but not always, this involves
    responding to a threat by posing an even greater threat, forcing the
    opponent to respond to the threat first.^[350]
